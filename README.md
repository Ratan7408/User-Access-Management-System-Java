User Access Management System
Introduction
The User Access Management System is a web-based application that streamlines the process of managing user access to software applications within an organization. This system allows employees to request access to applications, while managers can approve or reject these requests, and administrators can manage the software list and user permissions.

    access_levels TEXT CHECK (access_levels IN ('Read', 'Write', 'Admin'))
);

CREATE TABLE requests (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
    software_id INT REFERENCES software(id),
    access_type TEXT CHECK (access_type IN ('Read', 'Write', 'Admin')),
    reason TEXT,
